          <p>
            Datacenters and companies with underutilized capacity install the
            Akash agent on servers they want to add to the network. Once
            registered with the network, they become available for tenants to
            deploy containerized workloads to

          <h4 style="color: white">Allocation By Auction</h4>
          <p>
            Deployment slots are allocated via an auction process that begins
            with a user defining the deployment criteria (resources, topology,
            price) in a declarative file posted to the Akash blockchain.
            Providers then programmatically bid on the deployment, with the low
            bid winning and creating a lease between tenant and provider, again
            written to the chain

          <h4 style="color: white">Workload Distribution</h4>
          <p>
            Workloads are then distributed off chain via Akash's peer-to-peer
            file sharing protocol, and a secure overlay network established.
            Once live, the agreed-upon count of Akash tokens is transferred from
            tenant to provider periodically for as long as the workload is live,
            as determined by the network
